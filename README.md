Please note that Minecraft is a 3D sandbox game developed by Mojang Studios(Microsoft) where players interact with a fully modifiable three-dimensional environment made of blocks and entities.  And this project is a tutorial that shows how to make a game like Minecraft using Unity and DOTS technologies.

Packages needed:
Entities 1.0.0-exp.8
Entities graphics 1.0.0-exp.8
Unity Physics 1.0.0-exp.8

Unity Version:

It's been 4 years since last time I update this project. and I hope you can learn some Unity DOTS technologies from it! Enjoy it!
